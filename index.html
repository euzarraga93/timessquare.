    <!-- Our story -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>Times Square is a major commercial intersection, tourist destination, entertainment center, and neighborhood in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City, at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. Brightly lit by numerous
        billboards and advertisements, it stretches from West 42nd to West 47th Streets, and is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Crossroads of the World&quot;, &quot;the Center of the Universe&quot;, &quot;the heart of the Great White Way&quot;,
        and &quot;the heart of the world&quot;.</p>

      <p>One of the world's busiest pedestrian areas, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an
        estimated 50 million visitors annually.</p>

      <p>Times Square functions as a town square, but is not geometrically a square; it is closer in shape to a bowtie, with two triangles emanating roughly north and south from 45th Street, where Seventh Avenue intersects Broadway. Broadway runs
        diagonally, crossing through the horizontal and vertical street grid of Manhattan laid down by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and that intersection creates the &quot;bowtie&quot; shape of Times Square.</p>
